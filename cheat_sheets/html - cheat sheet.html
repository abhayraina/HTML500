Definitions:

	Element:
		The units that make up an HTML page.

	Tag:
		The special pieces of text that surround the content of an element.

	Nesting:
		The act of placing elements inside of other elements.

	Whitespace:
		Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and new lines. Anything beyond a single space is ignored by HTML. Thus, each word in an element could be written over separate lines, but they will be displayed with just a single space between them. 

	Attributes:
		Additional information assigned to the element. Examples: the URL location of an image, or a named reference to the element. Example: <a id="myLink" href="http://example.com">
-->

<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- Tells the browser that this an HTML file. -->
<html> <!-- Begins the base of HTML document. The HTML element contains all of our page's HTML. -->
	<head> <!-- The head element contains meta-information that is not displayed on the page itself, such as the page's title and references to external files. -->
		<title> <!-- The title of the page as displayed in the top bar of the browser. -->
			Page Title
		</title> <!-- This is a closing tag. It tells the browser that this structural piece of HTML code ends here. -->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css"> <!-- links in and adds css stylesheet information from the file specified in href -->
	
	</head> <!-- This is another closing tag. This tag closes the entire head element. -->

	<body> <!-- The body element is what contains all the HTML that web visitors actually see. -->

		<div> <!-- The DIV element will act as our container to separate sections of the page. -->
			
			<header> <!-- contains header content. Used for both page headers and section headers -->
				<h1>Heading Text</h1> <!-- Heading text, which the browser displays as large and bold. -->
				<h2>Subtitle</h2> <!-- ...heading tags range from h1 to h6, with h1 being at the largest font-size. -->
			</header>

			<section> <!-- contains content for a main section of a page, more specific than a div -->
				<p> <!-- The opening tag for a paragraph element. We oftentimes surround pure pieces of text in paragraph elements. -->
					Paragraph text, such as news content.
					<br /> <!-- Inserts a blank line. -->
					Sometimes you want to <span>highlight</span> <!-- segments specific words to allow for them to be customed styled later --> or <q>quote specific parts of a sentence</q>.  <!-- puts these words inside quotes -->
				</p>

				<ul> <!-- An 'unordered list': Bullet-point items. -->
					<li>Apples</li> <!-- Each list item is encased in an <li> element. -->
					<li>Bananas</li>
				</ul>

				<ol> <!-- An 'ordered list': Bullet-point items with prefixed numbers. -->
					<li class="list-item">Step 1</li> <!-- the class attribute gives an anchor in CSS to all elements sharing this class -->
					<li class="list-item">Step 2</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
		</div>

		<div id="image-container"> <!-- the id attribute gives a unique anchor to this single element in CSS --> 
			<img src="images/example.jpg"> <!-- Displays an image that is located at the url provided with the 'src' (short for source) attribute. This element does not require a closing tag since it has no content within it. --> 
			<a href="http://example.com/link"> <!-- A link to another page on the same site, or, as in this example, to another website entirely. We put the URL as the value of the HREF attribute. -->
				Click here!
			</a>
		</div>

		<footer> <!-- contains footer content. Used for both page footers and section footers -->
			Legal information and page navigation.
		</footer>

</body>
</html>
